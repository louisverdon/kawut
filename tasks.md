# Kawut Project Tasks

## Project Overview
Kawut is an Angular-based multiplayer quiz/game application with Firebase integration, featuring real-time gameplay, QR code functionality, and interactive scoring.

## Core Components
1. Home Component - Entry point and session creation
2. Lobby Component - Pre-game waiting room
3. Game Component - Main gameplay interface
4. Question Component - Question display and interaction
5. Scoreboard Component - Real-time score tracking
6. QRCode Component - Session joining via QR code

## Services
1. GameService - Core game logic and state management
2. FirebaseService - Backend integration and data persistence

## Current Tasks

### Phase 0: Visual Prototype (Priority) ✅
- [x] Implement mock data service for local testing
- [x] Set up routing between components
- [x] Create static game flow visualization
- [x] Create basic UI components without Firebase integration
- [x] Add placeholder QR code functionality
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors in game.service.ts and mock-data.service.ts

### Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation ✅
- [x] Review and document Firebase configuration
- [x] Analyze game flow and state management
- [x] Document component interactions
- [x] Review security rules and data structure

### Phase 2: Code Quality
- [ ] Review component architecture
- [ ] Analyze service implementations
- [ ] Check for proper error handling
- [ ] Review TypeScript type definitions

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Review existing test coverage
- [ ] Identify critical test scenarios
- [ ] Plan unit test implementation
